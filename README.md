# [E commerce market]

This project is built using Django REST Framework (DRF) for the backend API and Next.js for the frontend. It provides [brief description of the application placeholder].

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
- Node.js - [Node.js version placeholder]
- Python - [Python version placeholder]
- pip - Python package installer

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and run the setup commands for both backend and frontend components by following these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [Repository URL Placeholder]

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd [Backend Directory Name Placeholder]

# Install Python dependencies
virtualenv env
source senv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Apply migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Run the Django server
python manage.py runserver

# Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory
cd [Frontend Directory Name Placeholder]

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Start the Next.js server
npm run dev









This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
